# Maths II Project
Maths II subject final project at CITM UPC's Video Game Design and Development Degree.

## Project Description
This project is about how to develop a tool to control the orientation of 3D shapes by using a keyboard as input. 

What this tool does is to define rotations based on the user input, apply the rotation to the 3D model (rotate its frame)
and finally redraw the object refreshing the image on the screen. When this process is ran at high rates, it is possible 
to create the effect of interaction between the user and the 3D model.

## Key Features
- {WASD} -> Rotate cube
- {ARROWS} -> Translate cube
- {X} -> Shrink perspective
- {Z} -> Grow perspective
- {F} -> Idle cube rotation
- {R} -> Reset scenario
- {F11} -> Fullscreen mode
- {ESCAPE} -> EXIT
